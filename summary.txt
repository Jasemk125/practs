Objective

Simulate a high-level architecture and implementation brainstorming session between three senior software engineers, each with over 15 years of experience from leading technology regions (e.g., USA, Germany, Japan). These engineers will design and evaluate five distinct architecture and implementation strategies to build a secure, scalable, testable Java web application under the constraints and requirements outlined below.

Technology Stack

Java 8

Spring MVC

JSF (JavaServer Faces) with XHTML templating

Tomcat as the servlet container

Bootstrap 5 for frontend UI and theming

JSON files as the sole data source (no database)

Brainstorming Goals

Each engineer will:

Propose five high-level architecture and implementation strategies.

Evaluate each strategy with respect to:

Security

Maintainability

Scalability

JSON data handling

Testability

UI theming support

Select the top three strategies and document:

Pros and cons

Rationale for selection

Trade-offs

Functional Requirements
Authentication

login.xhtml with username and password fields

On success:

Load user JWT from jwt.json

Create session entry in sessions.json

Redirect based on role:

Admin → admin.xhtml

User → dashboard.xhtml

On failure:

Show error: "username or password is not correct"

User Dashboard (dashboard.xhtml)

View available products

Add products to cart

Place orders

View order history and status

Update profile (profile.xhtml)

Reset password

View notifications from notifications_user_{jwt}.json

Cart Page (cart.xhtml)

View, edit, and remove items

Proceed to order placement

Orders Page (orders.xhtml)

View previous orders

Track order status

Notifications Page (notifications.xhtml)

Display user-specific notifications

Mark notifications as read

Admin Dashboard (admin.xhtml)

Manage users and roles

Reset user passwords

Manage and approve orders

Filter orders by user, status, and date

View active sessions, expiration, and force logout

View system-wide notifications from notifications_admin.json

Configure and save UI themes using a form that updates theme_config.json

View admin logs from admin_logs.json

Splash Screen (splash.xhtml)

Display Bootstrap spinner while loading data

Security Requirements

JWT validation on all requests

Role-based page access enforcement

Session expiration and refresh using sessions.json

Encrypt sensitive fields in JSON (credentials, IP address, browser/device)

Log user and admin actions to user_logs.json and admin_logs.json

Testing Requirements

Test the system for:

Successful and failed logins

Expired or tampered JWTs

Unauthorized access to protected pages

Session expiration and refresh behavior

UI theme changes and persistence

Fallback theme behavior

Edge cases:

Missing or malformed JSON files

Concurrent logins or data updates

Spoofed sessions

Loading delays or asynchronous errors

UI Theming Requirements

All pages and components must use Bootstrap 5

Components must support dynamic theming configured by admin

Theming system must support:

Buttons

Cards

Modals

Forms

Tables

Accordions

Alerts

Navbars

Spinners

The theme must be loaded dynamically by ThemeBean and used in all templates through expression bindings (e.g., #{themeBean.theme.buttonClass})

Admins can update the theme via a form in admin.xhtml, which updates theme_config.json

A fallback theme must load if theme_config.json is missing or invalid

Sample theme_config.json structure:

{
  "themeName": "dark-blue",
  "primaryColor": "#0d6efd",
  "buttonClass": "btn btn-outline-primary",
  "cardClass": "card shadow-sm",
  "modalClass": "modal fade",
  "formClass": "form-control",
  "tableClass": "table table-bordered table-hover",
  "alertTypeMap": {
    "info": "alert alert-info",
    "success": "alert alert-success",
    "error": "alert alert-danger",
    "warning": "alert alert-warning"
  },
  "navbarClass": "navbar navbar-dark bg-dark",
  "spinnerClass": "spinner-border text-primary"
}

JavaBeans and Services

Design modular and reusable beans based on domain responsibilities. Avoid creating a separate bean for every page unless necessary.

Bean	Responsibility
LoginBean	Authenticate user, manage JWT and session creation
SessionBean	Handle session validation, expiration, refresh
UserBean	Manage profile, cart, orders
OrderBean	Process orders and retrieve product data
AdminBean	Manage users, roles, sessions, logs
NotificationBean	Manage notifications for users and admins
ThemeBean	Load and save theme configuration; expose binding expressions
