Simulate a brainstorming session between three senior software developers, each with 15+ years of experience, from top tech countries (e.g., USA, Germany, Japan).

These developers must:

Collaboratively design 5 high-level architecture and implementation ideas for building a secure, scalable, and testable Java web application using:

Java 8

Spring MVC

JSF with XHTML templating

Tomcat as the servlet container

JSON files as the data source (no relational database)

Bootstrap 5 with complete UI component theming support

Test and discuss the viability of each idea with respect to:

Security

Maintainability

Scalability

JSON data handling

Testability

UI theming

Narrow it down to the top 3 implementation ideas with full pros and cons, and rationale.

Project Goal

Build a secure, role-based web application using:

Java 8

Spring MVC

JSF (with XHTML templating)

Bootstrap 5 for frontend UI

Tomcat (servlet container)

JSON files as the data source

Admin-configurable Bootstrap 5 UI theming system

Functional Requirements

Login Page (login.xhtml)

Fields: username, password

On success:

Load user’s JWT from jwt.json

Create session entry in sessions.json

Redirect:

admin → /admin.xhtml

user → /dashboard.xhtml

On failure:

Display hidden error message: "username or password is not correct"

User Dashboard

View available products

Add products to cart

Place orders

View order history and statuses

View and update profile

Reset password

View user-specific notifications from notifications_user_{jwt}.json

Admin Dashboard

Manage users and their roles

Reset user passwords

Manage and approve orders

View and filter orders by user, status, and date

View active sessions, expiration, and force logout

View system-wide notifications from notifications_admin.json

Configure and save UI themes via a form that updates theme_config.json

JavaBeans and Service Responsibilities

Implement ManagedBeans or Spring services for:

LoginBean: Authenticates user, loads JWT, creates session

SessionBean: Manages sessions, expiration, refresh, logout

UserBean: Loads and updates profile, order history, cart

OrderBean: Handles orders and product retrieval

NotificationBean: Manages notifications, read/unread status

AdminBean: Role management, session control, logs

ThemeBean: Loads and saves theme configuration from theme_config.json

Security Requirements

JWT validation on all requests

Role-based page access enforcement

Session expiration and refresh logic from sessions.json

Encrypt sensitive fields in JSON (credentials, IPs, etc.)

JSON File Structure

jwt.json: username → JWT with encrypted credentials and role

sessions.json: active sessions with timestamps, IP, browser, device, expiration

user_{jwt}.json: user-specific data: cart, profile, orders

user_logs.json: all user actions, clicks, page views

admin_logs.json: admin actions, role changes, session controls

notifications_user_{jwt}.json: per-user alerts

notifications_admin.json: global admin alerts and logs

theme_config.json: UI configuration for Bootstrap components

theme_history.json: historical UI themes (optional)

UI and Theming Requirements

Use Bootstrap 5 throughout all pages

Components must support admin-defined theming

Theming system must support:

Buttons

Cards

Modals

Forms

Tables

Accordions

Alerts

Navbars

Spinners

Example configuration keys in theme_config.json:

{
  "themeName": "dark-blue",
  "primaryColor": "#0d6efd",
  "buttonClass": "btn btn-outline-primary",
  "cardClass": "card shadow-sm",
  "modalClass": "modal fade",
  "formClass": "form-control",
  "tableClass": "table table-bordered table-hover",
  "alertTypeMap": {
    "info": "alert alert-info",
    "success": "alert alert-success",
    "error": "alert alert-danger",
    "warning": "alert alert-warning"
  },
  "navbarClass": "navbar navbar-dark bg-dark",
  "spinnerClass": "spinner-border text-primary"
}


Themes must be loaded dynamically by ThemeBean and used in all JSF templates through expression bindings like #{themeBean.theme.buttonClass}.

Admins must be able to update these values through admin.xhtml, which updates theme_config.json.

A fallback theme must load if the config file is missing or invalid.

UI Components Required

Splash screen with Bootstrap spinner (splash.xhtml)

Login form (login.xhtml)

Admin dashboard with theme editor

User dashboard with product and order management

Table layouts for orders and logs

Bootstrap cards, modals, accordions, alerts, navbars

Loading states and asynchronous feedback for large JSON loads

Testing Scenarios

Successful and failed login

Expired or tampered JWT

Unauthorized access to role-protected pages

Session refresh and logout

Theme change persistence

Edge cases:

Missing JSON files

Malformed or corrupted JSON

Concurrent logins and browser spoofing

Fallback theme behavior
